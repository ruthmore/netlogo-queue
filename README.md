# netlogo-queue
Netlogo extension providing a queue (with statistics).

Queue is an extension for NetLogo (up to version 5.3.1), providing a commonly-used data type in discrete-event simulation. Objects can be inserted into a queue at a particular point in simulated time according to a specified queueing strategy (default is "first in , first out" (FIFO), but "last in, first out" (LIFO) is also supported). Requests to remove an element from a queue always returns the top-most object. 

Queues can be questioned as to their current status (length, empty?) and time-weighted statistics are calculated (mean length, max length, mean waiting time, max waiting time). Trying to insert an object with an associated simulation time lying in the past (i.e. a simulation time < last access time of the queue) throws an exception.
